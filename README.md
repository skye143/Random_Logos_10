## Description
This application is designed to assist web developers in creating simple logos for their clients and projects. The software employs inquirer to prompt the user within the command line to determine the specific characteristics of the desired logo, such as the text to display (up to 3 characters), the text color, the shape of the logo (square, triangle, or circle), and the color of the shape. Once the user has answered all prompts, the application generates an SVG file based on their selections to produce the final logo.

This application also represents my initial implementation of unit testing within my development process. The code employs a single test suite that includes three tests, which verify the accuracy of the code base in delivering correct shapes and colors.

Potential future enhancements for this application could involve expanding the available color palette for logos, implementing further unit testing, and incorporating a greater variety of polygons and font styles to provide users with additional customization options.

## Technologies Used

- The project is based on Node.js v16.
- Inquirer v8.2.4 (Node Package Manager) is utilized in the project.
- The File System module (Node Package Manager) is also employed in the project.
- Jest v29.5.0 (Node Package Manager) is used for conducting unit testing in the application.

## Installation

1. Go to my github and use my repo:
https://github.com/skye143/Random_Logos_10.git

2. Clone the repo:
git clone git@github.com:skye143/Random_Logos_10.git

3. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

4. Using the terminal, install npm i. and then download node.js v16.

5. nce node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

6. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install inquirer and jest directly from the command line, to do so the command for inquirer will be npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer, and npm i jest to install the latest version of jest).

7. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.

## Features

This application offers a range of features, including the ability for users to quickly and efficiently generate logos via the use of SVG files. Notably, this process is entirely command line-driven, requiring no front-end tools or user interface.

## Usage Information

To launch the application, navigate to its directory using the command line and install all dependencies by typing "npm i". After that, run the command "node index.js" to start the program. You'll be prompted with a set of questions, and upon answering them correctly, a message will appear on the command line confirming that your logo has been generated. The newly created SVG file will contain your new logo.
