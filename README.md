## Description
This application is designed to assist web developers in creating simple logos for their clients and projects. The software employs inquirer to prompt the user within the command line to determine the specific characteristics of the desired logo, such as the text to display (up to 3 characters), the text color, the shape of the logo (square, triangle, or circle), and the color of the shape. Once the user has answered all prompts, the application generates an SVG file based on their selections to produce the final logo.

This application also represents my initial implementation of unit testing within my development process. The code employs a single test suite that includes three tests, which verify the accuracy of the code base in delivering correct shapes and colors.

Potential future enhancements for this application could involve expanding the available color palette for logos, implementing further unit testing, and incorporating a greater variety of polygons and font styles to provide users with additional customization options.
